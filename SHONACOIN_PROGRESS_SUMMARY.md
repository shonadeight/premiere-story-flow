## 📈 Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** M-Pesa API integration complexity
- **Impact:** High (revenue blocker)
- **Mitigation:** Start Phase 5 early, use sandbox extensively, have fallback to manual processing

**Risk:** Real-time negotiation performance at scale
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Use Supabase Realtime best practices, implement pagination, add debouncing

**Risk:** Marketing API rate limits
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Implement caching, batch requests, respect rate limits, show clear errors

**Risk:** Security vulnerabilities
- **Impact:** High (launch blocker)
- **Mitigation:** Dedicated security phase, third-party audit, bug bounty program

### Timeline Risks

**Risk:** Scope creep during negotiation development
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:** Stick to MVP features, defer "nice-to-haves", time-box each feature

**Risk:** Payment provider approval delays
- **Impact:** High
- **Mitigation:** Start provider applications early, have manual processing fallback

**Risk:** Testing finding critical bugs late
- **Impact:** Medium
- **Mitigation:** Continuous testing during development, automated test suite
