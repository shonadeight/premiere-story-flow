2. **Core Features**: Phases 3-4 (Creation + UX)
3. **Value Adds**: Phases 5-6 (Intelligence + Wallet)
4. **Production**: Phase 7 (Scaling)

### Success Metrics per Phase

### Dependencies
- Each phase builds on the previous
- Database schema must support all timeline types from Phase 1
- UI component library needs to be established early
- API structure should accommodate future phases

### Risk Mitigation
- Maintain backward compatibility during transitions
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollouts
- Regular user testing at end of each phase
- Documentation updates with each phase completion
